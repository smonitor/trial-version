Testing the apps first...

# .jar files
JAVA is 'ready for action' on your system (but deb packages won't work for you). 
Just download the Java Archives (JAR) and start from there. 

    java -jar smonitor.jar
    
    java -jar ttimer.jar
    

# .deb packages
Installation via command line 

    sudo dpkg -i [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]smonitor-2.0.deb

There are some graphical tools to install Debian packages (.deb) too, e.g. "qapt", "gdebi", ... 

To remove the packages afterwards is also very easy 

    sudo dpkg -r [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -r [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]smonitor-2.0.deb

Of course, you could leave them on your system as well.
