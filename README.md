Testing the apps first...

Installation via command line 

    sudo dpkg -i [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]smonitor-2.0.deb

There are some graphical tools to install Debian packages (.deb) too, e.g. "qapt", "gdebi", ... 

To remove the packages afterwards is also very easy 

    sudo dpkg -r [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -r [/home/"NAME"/Downloads/]smonitor-2.0.deb

Of course, you could leave them on your system as well.  ;)
